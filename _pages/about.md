<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a **Marie Sklodowska-Curie Researcher** and Ph.D. student at the School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K., supervised by Prof. Xiaowei Zhao 

My current research focuses on stability analysis (both small- & large-signal) and control design for grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs). Additionally, I have experience in designs/applications of controller hardware-in-the-loop and rapid-control prototyping. I am proficient in RT-LAB (Opal-RT technologies), RSCAD, PSCAD,  Simulink, Matlab programming.

I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Suo5XS0AAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Suo5XS0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
