<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a **Marie Sklodowska-Curie Researcher** and Ph.D. student at the School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K., supervised by Prof. Xiaowei Zhao. 

My current research focuses on stability analysis (both small- & large-signal) and control design for grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs). Additionally, I have experience in designs/applications of controller hardware-in-the-loop and rapid-control prototyping. I am proficient in RT-LAB (Opal-RT technologies), RSCAD, PSCAD,  Simulink, Matlab programming.
